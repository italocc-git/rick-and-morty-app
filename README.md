Rick and Morty is an application created in Next JS and was a challenge proposed by the company Green Access as part of a selection process.

The project consists of a character list screen with search and pagination and a details screen that should contain information about the characters from the Rick and Morty series and an option to favor or not the character. <b> <i> </i> The entire application was built from scratch in one week </b>
